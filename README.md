# [Project1 : Wavelet Coherance and Phase Difference Calculation of EEG signals / Their subbands](https://github.com/grinsted/wavelet-coherence/blob/master/README.md)
Examined Correlation in the frequency domain between EEG electrode pairs
After Wavelet transform section, find EEG rhythm from coefficient 

# Project2 : Wavelet Entropy Calculation of EEG signals
Examined Relative Entropy and Wavelet Entropy of EEG signals/ Their subbands
